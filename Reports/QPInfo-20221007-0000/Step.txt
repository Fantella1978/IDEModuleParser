I updated to Patch 1 yesterday, the LSP was working fine before the patch.  i followed the install instructions exactly, wit oe exception.  The paths shown in the readme contain double \\ between each segment of the path.  When I updated the registry I only used a single slash.

Asfor this crash, I closed a proeject due to code insight spinning out and reopend it and got the invalid pointer error.
