It seems like the LSP is broken on this update as well.  The codesight is stuck on indexing one remaining file.  When errors do occur in the IDE, they are hi-lighted but the underlines don't go away even after the error is finxed.  For example if in the header I have one signature for a method and I implement them method and say reverse the arguments, I get an errorm which is correct.  But when I fix the signature the error does not go away, it hangs for a ling time, then will dissappear.  
Also if there is an error, code insight may work or may not, mainly not...
