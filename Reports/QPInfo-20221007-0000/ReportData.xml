	<Description>Invalid pointer operation.

It seems like the LSP is broken on this update as well.  The codesight is stuck on indexing one remaining file.  When errors do occur in the IDE, they are hi-lighted but the underlines don't go away even after the error is finxed.  For example if in the header I have one signature for a method and I implement them method and say reverse the arguments, I get an errorm which is correct.  But when I fix the signature the error does not go away, it hangs for a ling time, then will dissappear.  
Also if there is an error, code insight may work or may not, mainly not...</Description>

	<Steps>I updated to Patch 1 yesterday, the LSP was working fine before the patch.  i followed the install instructions exactly, wit oe exception.  The paths shown in the readme contain double \\ between each segment of the path.  When I updated the registry I only used a single slash.

Asfor this crash, I closed a proeject due to code insight spinning out and reopend it and got the invalid pointer error.</Steps>
